Hi, I am Jasper Dijkstra, working on Nature-based solutions (NBS) at Deltares, a not-for-profit research and consultancy institute from the Netherlands. 
With the broader NBSDynamics modelling community, we develop and apply tools to assess the development of NBS over time. These tools support both academic 
research and inform coastal and river management authorities on the effectivity of NBS over their design life. These tools are based on our open source
software for hydro- and morphodynamics (e.g. Delft3D-Flexible Mesh, XBeach, SWAN) and a Python package for ecology of corals, marshes, mangroves and seagrasses
(under development). Interested in using and/or contributing to these tools? Please contact me at jasper.dijkstra@deltares.nl 
or https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasper-dijkstra-11110b2/.
